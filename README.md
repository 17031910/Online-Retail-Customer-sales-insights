Online Retail Sales Analysis – Customer & Product Insights
Project Overview

This project analyses an online retail dataset to understand sales performance, customer behaviour, and product trends. The goal is to provide actionable insights to improve revenue, customer engagement, and business strategy.

The analysis combines Python (Google Colab) for data cleaning and exploratory analysis with Power BI for interactive visualizations and business storytelling.

Dataset

The dataset contains transactional sales data with the following key fields:

Invoice Number

Product Description

Quantity & Unit Price

Invoice Date

Customer ID

Country

Data was cleaned to remove missing values, negative or zero quantities/prices, and dates were converted to datetime format. Derived fields such as Total Revenue, Month, and Year were created for analysis.

Tools & Technologies

Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn) – Data cleaning, analysis, and visualizations

Jupyter / Google Colab – Interactive analysis environment

Power BI – Interactive dashboards for business insights
